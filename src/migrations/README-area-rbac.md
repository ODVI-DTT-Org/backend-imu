# Area-Based RBAC — Migration Tracker

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-area-rbac-group-assignment-design.md`

## Stage 1 — Additive Schema  ✅ DONE

- `120_create_group_role_members.sql` — new role-aware membership table
- `121_create_group_caravan_municipalities.sql` — caravan slice, (province, municipality) composite
- `122_create_assignment_audit.sql` — audit trail
- `123_alter_group_municipalities_softdelete.sql` — add deleted_at + assigned_by + assigned_at to existing pool table
- `124_create_group_invariant_triggers.sql` — three invariant triggers

No production code reads/writes these tables yet. They are inert.

The legacy `group_members` table (45 rows, `client_id` schema) is untouched.
Deprecated in Stage 5 after Stage 2 backfills its rows into
`group_role_members(role_in_group='caravan')`.

### Follow-up flagged for Stage 3

Because migration 123 added `deleted_at` to `group_municipalities`, every existing
read query against this table must be audited to add `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
before any write path is allowed to soft-delete a pool row. Current call sites
(grep `group_municipalities` in `backend-imu/src/`):

- `routes/groups.ts`
- `routes/dashboard.ts`
- `queues/processors/reports-processor.ts`
- `queues/processors/handlers/itinerary-analysis-handler.ts`
- `schema.sql`

Stage 1 ships with NO writer that soft-deletes pool rows — so this is dormant.

## Stage 2 — Backfill ETL  ✅ DONE

- `125_backfill_group_role_members.sql` — area heads, asst, TLs, caravans
- `126_backfill_group_municipalities.sql` — pool derived from caravan user_locations
- `127_backfill_group_caravan_municipalities.sql` — slices derived from user_locations

Source: `backend-imu/scripts/area-rbac/cuecard-assignments.json` for TL identification
(cue card "as of 5.5.26"); other roles came from `groups.{area_manager_id,
assistant_area_manager_id}` and legacy `group_members.client_id`.

Final counts (verified 2026-06-07):
- area_head: 6, assistant_area_head: 2, team_leader: 8, caravan: 29
- group_municipalities pool: 1129 rows (17–292 per group)
- group_caravan_municipalities slices: 1378 rows across 29 caravans

Note: Plan expected caravan=37 (45 group_members − 8 TL). Actual is 29 because
all 6 AH and 2 AAH are also in group_members (16 elevated overlap, not 8).
Assertion bounds widened to 25-45 in migration 125 and the test.

Legacy `group_members` table still untouched. Stage 5 will drop it.
## Stage 3a — Read switching + RBAC seed  ✅ DONE (2026-06-08)

### Migrations

- `128_create_group_role_members_mirror_triggers.sql` — mirror triggers from
  legacy `group_members` and `groups.{area_manager_id, assistant_area_manager_id}`
  into `group_role_members`. Keeps the existing Vue admin UI producing valid RBAC
  data without any UI changes. (commits 33df535, 04ad431)
- `129_seed_area_rbac_permissions.sql` — additive: inserts 10 new `permissions`
  rows with `constraint_name IN ('group_municipalities', 'caravan_municipalities')`
  and 21 new `role_permissions` links. Existing `'own'`/`'area'`/`'all'` rows and
  their links are LEFT IN PLACE so `requirePermission()` middleware keeps working.

### New helper

- `src/utils/scope.ts` — `resolveClientScope(userId)` + `applyClientScope()`.
  Reads ONLY the new vocabulary from `role_permissions`. Precedence: new vocab
  wins over legacy `'all'` (critical: area_manager and asst have both, so new-
  vocab-first ensures they get `group_municipalities`, not `unrestricted`). If no
  matching row → `denied` → zero rows (safe fallback).

### Routes switched

- `src/routes/clients.ts` — 3 sites replaced: `/nearby`, `/pipeline`, `/assigned`.
  Deleted inline `ROLE_LEVELS` maps and `user_locations`-based PSGC filter in all
  three. Now calls `resolveClientScope` + `applyClientScope` at each site.
- `src/routes/itineraries.ts` — 1 site replaced: itinerary suggestions endpoint.

### Audit

- `src/queues/processors/reports-processor.ts` — added `WHERE gm.deleted_at IS NULL`
  to the `group_municipalities` read in the assigned_group CTE. (Task 7)

### Tests

- `test/migrations/group-mirror-triggers.test.ts` — 7 scenarios for mirror trigger
  behavior (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/idempotency).
- `test/utils/scope.test.ts` — 9 tests: SQL-splicing unit tests + prod-DB integration.
- `test/routes/clients-rbac.test.ts` — 5 smoke tests: admin unrestricted, caravan
  scoped, area_manager scoped (NOT unrestricted — key precedence regression guard),
  isolation check, orphan-row check.

### Key adjustment vs. plan

The plan's Task 4 helper used `'all'-wins` precedence, which would have treated
`area_manager` (which has both a legacy `'all'` link AND the new
`'group_municipalities'` link) as unrestricted. Fixed with new-vocabulary-first
precedence (`caravan_municipalities` → `group_municipalities` → `'all'/NULL`).
Only `admin` (which was intentionally skipped from new-vocab seeding) reaches
the `'all'` fallback → unrestricted.

### Stage 3b — next

New group management API endpoints in `routes/groups.ts` (POST members, POST
caravans, PATCH caravans/municipalities, DELETE caravans). The feature flag
`manageTeamWritesEnabled` in the Flutter app remains `false` until Stage 3b lands.

## Stage 3b — Group management endpoints  ✅ DONE (2026-06-08)

### New utility
- `src/utils/assignment-audit.ts` — `writeAssignmentAudit()` helper, writes one row
  to `assignment_audit` on every successful mutation.

### Routes appended to `src/routes/groups.ts` (lines 823+)
- `POST   /:id/role-members` — admin-only; assigns `area_head` / `assistant_area_head` / `tele`
- `DELETE /:id/role-members/:userId/:role` — admin-only; soft-delete a role membership
- `POST   /:id/team-leaders` — admin or area_head; inserts `team_leader` row
- `DELETE /:id/team-leaders/:userId` — admin or area_head; soft-delete TL
- `POST   /:id/caravans` — admin / area_head / asst / TL; caravan + initial slice
- `PATCH  /:id/caravans/:userId/municipalities` — full-replace slice (diff + soft-delete + insert)
- `DELETE /:id/caravans/:userId` — soft-delete caravan membership + all slices atomically

Existing 12 endpoints (lines 1–822) UNTOUCHED. Paths are distinct from legacy
`POST /:id/members` to avoid routing collisions.

### Error mapping
- `err.message?.includes('municipality_not_in_group_pool')` → 400 ValidationError
- `err.code === '23505' && constraint.includes('one_group_for_tl')` → 400 ValidationError
- `err.code === '23505' && constraint.includes('one_group_for_caravan')` → 400 ValidationError
- `rowCount === 0` on DELETE → 404 NotFoundError
- Non-member actor → 401 AuthenticationError (via `ensureGroupAccess`)

### Adjustments vs. plan
- `ValidationError(msg, details)` is single-arg in this codebase; used `.addDetail()` chaining.
- `c.req.param()` returns `string | undefined` in this Hono version; added `?? ''` null coalescing.
- Tests use direct DB queries rather than HTTP (authMiddleware requires POWERSYNC_PUBLIC_KEY
  at import time, making in-process Hono setup impractical for CI). Existing test pattern
  in `clients-rbac.test.ts` uses the same approach.

### Tests
- `test/routes/groups-caravans.test.ts` — 7 tests: trigger validation, valid insert,
  cardinality block, PATCH diff logic, DELETE atomicity, access control, orphan check
- `test/routes/groups-team-leaders.test.ts` — 6 tests: happy path, cardinality, remove,
  not-found, access check, orphan check
- `test/routes/groups-role-members.test.ts` — 7 tests: assign, idempotency, delete,
  invalid role, not-found, admin check, orphan check

All 20 tests pass. Orphan count = 0 after each run.

### Next: Stage 4a-write
## Stage 4a — Mobile read foundation  ✅ DONE

Sync rules added for `group_role_members`, `group_municipalities`,
`group_caravan_municipalities` (additive — no impact on existing tables).
Mobile gains `RoleProvider` + Manage Team screen (read-only display).
`ClientApiService.fetchAssignedClients()` upserts results into local PowerSync
as a bridge to Stage 4b.

Feature flag `manageTeamWritesEnabled` is `false` by default — slice editor's
Save button is disabled with a "Coming soon" tooltip until Stage 3 backend
endpoints ship.

**Manual deploy step:** The new sync rule blocks must be pushed to PowerSync
Cloud (via the PowerSync console or CLI). Until that happens, mobile devices
see empty `group_role_members` etc., and the Manage Team tab won't appear.

Feature flag location:
`frontend-mobile-imu/imu_flutter/lib/features/manage_team/presentation/caravan_slice_editor.dart`
— `const bool manageTeamWritesEnabled = false` at top of file. Flip to `true`
to enable write mutations once Stage 3 backend endpoints are live.

## Stage 4a-write — Manage Team mutations  (not started)

Depends on Stage 3 backend endpoints landing first. Will wire up the slice
editor's Save button + offline mutation queue + flip `manage_team_writes_enabled`
to true.

## Stage 4b — Narrow clients sync rule  (not started)

Modifies the existing `clients` sync rule to push only the assigned subset
per user. Ships after Stage 4a stable in production for ≥1 week.

## Stage 5 — Cleanup  (not started)
